# occurd.

Biodiversity occurrence records, mapped. Draw a polygon, set your filters, fetch from GBIF — no login, no install, no backend.

**[Open occurd.](https://rutherfordecology.github.io/GBIF-Record-Finder/)**

---

## What it does

Draw one or more polygons on the map (or drop in a KML/KMZ file), set a date range and taxon filter, and pull all matching occurrence records from GBIF for that area. Results appear as clustered points or a heatmap, alongside a species checklist and export options.

---

## Features

- **Draw polygons** directly on the map, or import KML/KMZ files
- **Query GBIF** — live occurrence data, no account needed
- **Filter by taxon group** — Birds, Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, Insects, Plants, Fungi, and more
- **Filter by date range** — defaults to the last 5 years
- **Points or heatmap** view
- **Species checklist** — click a species to highlight its records on the map, with photos from iNaturalist
- **Record photos** — where available, view the photo attached to an individual occurrence and toggle back to the species photo
- **Export** — CSV, GeoJSON, KML, or a species list CSV
- **Coordinate precision warning** — flags low-precision records (>1.5 km uncertainty)
- **Mobile friendly** — works on phones and tablets

## How to use

1. **Draw an area** — click the polygon tool (top-left of map) and draw your study area. Multiple polygons are supported. Alternatively, drop a KML or KMZ file onto the drop zone.
2. **Set parameters** — adjust the date range and taxon group filter if needed.
3. **Fetch** — click *Fetch occurrences from GBIF*. A cancel button appears while fetching.
4. **Explore** — switch between Points and Heatmap, filter by taxon chips, or open the species checklist.
5. **Export** — download your results as CSV, GeoJSON, KML, or a species list.

## Data sources

- Occurrence records: [GBIF Occurrence Search API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence)
- Species photos: [iNaturalist Taxa API](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference)
- Basemap: OpenStreetMap / Esri World Imagery

All data is fetched live at query time — nothing is stored on any server.

---

## Technical notes

- Single-file app (`index.html`) — no build step, no dependencies to install
- Uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping and [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) for polygon drawing
- Queries the GBIF API directly from the browser — no backend required
- Works entirely client-side; your data stays in your browser

---

## Limitations

- Capped at 10,000 records per fetch — very large areas or broad taxon filters may hit this limit
- GBIF data quality varies; low-precision records are flagged but not excluded
- Taxon classification relies on GBIF's supplied `class` and `order` fields, which are occasionally missing or inconsistent
